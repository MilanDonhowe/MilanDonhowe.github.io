<p>For this problem weâ€™re given a situation where a malicious program was detected on a victimâ€™s PC and provided a zip file containing a pcap (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">evidence.pcap</code>) and a bash script (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mal.sh</code>).  Our goal is to determine what the malware did and recover the exfiltrated flag.</p>
