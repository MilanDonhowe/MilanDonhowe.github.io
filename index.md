# Hi there!

My name is Milan Donhowe, and I’m a Computer Science student at the College of Engineering at Oregon State University.  This website serves to present my many miscellaneous programming projects which you can check out over on the portfolio tab of this website.

When I’m not studying or working on a programming project I typically spend my time playing guitar, practicing Spanish or exploring the Internet.


## Want to contact me?

If you want to reach me for college related purposes you can shoot me an email at [donhowem@oregonstate.edu](mailto:donhowem@oregonstate.edu).

Otherwise you can reach me at [milanaugust@gmail.com](mailto:milanaugust@gmail.com), or you can try putting a message in a glass bottle and throwing it off the west-coast of the US and I might end up stumbling across it.


Since all personal websites must have an inspirational quote here is mine: 

<q> O I am slain! </q> --(Polonius, Act III, Scene 4, Line 30)
