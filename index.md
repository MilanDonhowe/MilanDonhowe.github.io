# Hi there!

My name is Milan, and I am Senior at Cleveland High School who likes to partake in some high-stakes hijinks.  Such hijinks include: being the **National Speech & Debate Coordinator** for the Cleveland Cannibals Speech & Debate team, **mentoring for an Introduction to Programming class**, running Cross Country and **developing some neat programs**.  In my free-time I like to play guitar, practice Spanish, and explore the Internet.

## Want to contact me?

You can send me an [email](mailto:milanaugust@gmail.com) at milanaugust@gmail.com, or you can try putting a message in a glass bottle and throwing it off the west-coast of the US and I might end up stumbling across it.


Since all personal websites must have an inspirational quote here is mine: 
*"O I am slain!"*(Polonius, Act III, Scene 4, Line 30)
