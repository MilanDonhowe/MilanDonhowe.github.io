# About me
My name's Milan and I'm an applied CS student at Oregon State University from the city of the roses (Portland, Oregon) with a strong interest in all things relating to data, code and automation.

I currently work part-time as a Systems Engineering Intern in the Automation Team at the Niagara Bottling Company.

Outside of work and school, my main hobby relates to competing in Capture-The-Flag (CTF) Competitions (which I compete in with OSUSEC) where I focus on web/rev/pwn but hope to someday also get good at cryptography.  I also help out as one of the many volunteer coaches for OSUSEC's internal [CTF League](https://www.osusec.org/ctf-league/) where we write introductory challenges and help get beginners into CTF.

You can see a few of my CTF write-ups at the "write-ups" tab of this website, or alternative you can see some of my personal programming projects over on the portfolio tab of this website.
