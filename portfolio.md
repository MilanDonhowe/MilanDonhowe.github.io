## Miscellaneous Programming Projects

### Comic Sans Bookmarklet (JavaScript)
A small url-embedded block of JavaScript code that changes all the fonts on a given web-page to Comic Sans MS.  You can install it by simply dragging the following link into your bookmark bar and then clicking it to run the program.  (Given that your Browser has JavaScript enabled.)

###  Poll-Boy (Python)
Poll-Boy is a simple bot that I programmed using the library discord.py to add simple yes or no polls.  The idea was to make a better alternative to straw-polls for Discord servers.

### sMath (LUA)
An on-going project of mine to build a simple math library in LUA.

### Font Randomizer (Google App Script)
A *very* simple program that randomly changes the font and font-size of a Google docs document.  Made after a dare in my English class.
