# Hello!

My name's Milan and I'm an applied CS student at Oregon State University (OSU) from the city of the roses (Portland, Oregon) with a strong interest in all things relating to data, code and automation.

I currently work part-time as a Systems Engineering Intern at the Niagara Bottling Company, and part-time as a Student Software Engineering for the [OSU Office of Sustainability](https://fa.oregonstate.edu/sustainability/about/sustainability-office).  

Outside of academics and work, I help out as one of the volunteer coaches for OSUSECâ€™s internal [CTF League](https://www.osusec.org/ctf-league/) and compete with the team in Capture-The-Flag (CTF) competitions.  You can see a few of my CTF write-ups at the "write-ups" tab of this website.

This website also serves to present some of my personal programming projects which you can check out over on the portfolio tab of this website.
