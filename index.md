# Hi there!

My name is Milan, and I’m a Computer Science student at the College of Engineering at Oregon State University.  In addition to my studies I spend a good amount of time doing extracurricular activities like competing in **Speech & Debate**, volunteering Sunday mornings at the **RESIstore**, and attending **OSUSEC team meetings**.  But when I’m not doing any of those things I typically spend my time playing guitar, practicing Spanish or exploring the Internet.


This website serves to present my many programming projects which you can check out over on the portfolio tab of this website.

Additionally, you can view my resume [right here](./Resume.pdf).



## Want to contact me?

If you want to reach me for college related purposes you can shoot me an email at [donhowem@oregonstate.edu](mailto:donhowem@oregonstate.edu).

Otherwise you can reach me at [milanaugust@gmail.com](mailto:milanaugust@gmail.com), or you can try putting a message in a glass bottle and throwing it off the west-coast of the US and I might end up stumbling across it.


Since all personal websites must have an inspirational quote here is mine: 

<q> O I am slain! </q> --(Polonius, Act III, Scene 4, Line 30)
