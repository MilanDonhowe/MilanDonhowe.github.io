# Sp0ng3.github.io
This was an old game I made in gamemaker studio for my introduction to programming class about a year ago, It was originally
hosted on google's single page webpage service however google recently ended that particular service.  So I've decided to transition it to github's webpage service so as I can continue to use it as a example of my work.

I am already aware of most of the bugs and glitches present, sadly I do not have the time on my hands to go back and fix them given that it was made on a older version of gamemaker studio and I haven't really used the tool in awhile and don't see much point in doing so given I have many newer and more exciting things to work on. Im sorry to dissapoint anyone who was hoping for a future in development.

Hopefully you can find some enjoyment in it.  Just type Sp0ng3.github.io in your search bar to connect if ye wish to play it.
