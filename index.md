# Hi there!

My name is Milan, and I’m a undergraduate student studying **Applied Computer Science at Oregon State University (OSU)**.  In addition to my studies, I currently work as a **University Learning Assistant** for CS 162, "Introduction to Computer Science II" at OSU. I also spend a good amount of time doing extracurricular activities like competing in **Speech & Debate** and competing in **OSUSEC**’s internal CTF League.  But when I’m not doing any of the above, I typically spend my time reading various the news publications, practicing Spanish or exploring the Internet.


This website serves to present my many programming projects which you can check out over on the portfolio tab of this website.


## Want to contact me?

If you want to reach me for college related purposes you can shoot me an email at [donhowem@oregonstate.edu](mailto:donhowem@oregonstate.edu).

Otherwise you can reach me at [milanaugust@gmail.com](mailto:milanaugust@gmail.com), or you can try putting a message in a glass bottle and throwing it off the west-coast of the US and I might end up stumbling across it.


Since all personal websites must have an inspirational quote here is mine: 

<q> O I am slain! </q> --(Polonius, Act III, Scene 4, Line 30)
