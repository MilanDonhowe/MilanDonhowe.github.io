I"Æ<h1 id="hi-there">Hi there!</h1>

<p>My name is Milan.  Iâ€™m a undergraduate student studying <strong>Applied Computer Science at Oregon State University (OSU)</strong> with the Data Science option.  I currently work part-time as a <strong>Student Software Engineer</strong> for the <a href="https://fa.oregonstate.edu/sustainability/about/sustainability-office">OSU Office of Sustainability</a>.  Outside of academics and work, I compete with <strong>OSUâ€™s Speech &amp; Debate Team</strong> and help out as a coach for <strong>OSUSEC</strong>â€™s internal <a href="https://www.osusec.org/ctf-league/">CTF League</a>.</p>

<p>This website serves to present some of my personal programming projects which you can check out over on the portfolio tab of this website.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you wish to see some of my CTF writeups you can check those out too!</p>

<h2 id="want-to-contact-me">Want to contact me?</h2>

<p>If you want to reach me for college related purposes you can shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:donhowem@oregonstate.edu">donhowem@oregonstate.edu</a>.</p>

<p>Otherwise you can reach me at <a href="mailto:milanaugust@gmail.com">milanaugust@gmail.com</a>, or you can try putting a message in a glass bottle and throwing it off the west-coast of the US and I might end up stumbling across it.</p>

<p>Since all personal websites must have an inspirational quote here is mine:</p>

<p><q> O I am slain! </q> â€“(Polonius, Act III, Scene 4, Line 30)</p>
