This was an old game I made in gamemaker studio for my introduction to programming class (2015-2016), It was originally
hosted on google's single page web page service however google recently ended that particular service.  So I've decided to transition it to github's webpage service so as I can continue to use it as a example of my work.
I am already aware of most of the bugs and glitches present, sadly I do not have the time on my hands to go back and fix them given that it was made on a older version of gamemaker studio which I no longer have access to.

Hopefully you can find some enjoyment in it.  You can play it [here.](https://milandonhowe.github.io/)
