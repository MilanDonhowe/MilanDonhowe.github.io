# Hi there!

My name is Milan--and this is my personal website!

I'm a Applied Computer Science student at Oregon State University (OSU) from the city of the roses (Portland, Oregon) with a strong interest in all things data, code and cyber-security related.  Currently, I work part-time as a **Student Software Engineer** for the [OSU Office of Sustainability](https://fa.oregonstate.edu/sustainability/about/sustainability-office).  

Outside of academics and work, I help out as a coach for **OSUSEC**â€™s internal [CTF League](https://www.osusec.org/ctf-league/)--and recently started competing in CTF competitions with OSUSEC.  You can see a few of my CTF write-ups at the "write-ups" tab of this website.

This website also serves to present some of my personal programming projects which you can check out over on the portfolio tab of this website.


## Want to contact me?

If you want to contact me, you can shoot me an email at [donhowem@oregonstate.edu](mailto:donhowem@oregonstate.edu)--or you can try putting a message in a glass bottle and throwing it off the west-coast of the US and I might end up stumbling across it.


Since all personal websites must have an inspirational quote here is mine: 

<q> O I am slain! </q> --(Polonius, Act III, Scene 4, Line 30)
