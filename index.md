# Milan Donhowe
Hey there!

My name's Milan, I build and, sometimes, break software.

I have a lot of interests in the computer-science space, and so my expertise and skillset is a bit all over the place.

You can checkout my silly little projects on my github [https://github.com/MilanDonhowe](https://github.com/MilanDonhowe).
