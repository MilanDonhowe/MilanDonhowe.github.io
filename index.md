# About me

My name's Milan, and this is my perpetually out-of-date github.io website.

I have a lot of interests in the computer-science space, and so my expertise and skillset is a bit all over the place.

This website largely serves as a location for my CTF write-ups (CTFs are basically gamified hacking challenges) which you can check out over at the [CTF Writeups Tab](/writeups/index.html) of this website.
