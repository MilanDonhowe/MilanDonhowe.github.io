# Hi there!

My name is Milan.  I’m a undergraduate student studying **Applied Computer Science at Oregon State University (OSU)** with the Data Science option.  I currently work part-time as a **Student Software Engineer** for the [OSU Office of Sustainability](https://fa.oregonstate.edu/sustainability/about/sustainability-office).  Outside of academics and work, I compete with **OSU's Speech & Debate Team** and help out as a coach for **OSUSEC**’s internal [CTF League](https://www.osusec.org/ctf-league/).

This website serves to present some of my personal programming projects which you can check out over on the portfolio tab of this website.

Alternatively, if you wish to see some of my CTF writeups you can check those out too!

## Want to contact me?

If you want to reach me for college related purposes you can shoot me an email at [donhowem@oregonstate.edu](mailto:donhowem@oregonstate.edu).

Otherwise you can reach me at [milanaugust@gmail.com](mailto:milanaugust@gmail.com), or you can try putting a message in a glass bottle and throwing it off the west-coast of the US and I might end up stumbling across it.


Since all personal websites must have an inspirational quote here is mine: 

<q> O I am slain! </q> --(Polonius, Act III, Scene 4, Line 30)
